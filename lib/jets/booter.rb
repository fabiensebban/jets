    # require_bundle_gems called when environment boots up via Jets.boot.  It
    # also useful for when to loading Rake tasks in
    # Jets::Commands::RakeTasks.load!
    #
    # For example, some gems like webpacker that load rake tasks are specified
    # with a git based source:
    #
    #   gem "webpacker", git: "https://github.com/tongueroo/webpacker.git"
    #
    # This results in the user having to specific bundle exec in front of
    # jets for those rake tasks to show up in jets help.
    #
    # Instead, when the user is within the project folder, jets automatically
    # requires bundler for the user. So the rake tasks show up when calling
    # jets help.
    #
    # When the user calls jets help from outside the project folder, bundler
    # is not used and the load errors get rescued gracefully.  This is done in
    # Jets::Commands::RakeTasks.load!  In the case when there are in another
    # project with another Gemfile, the load errors will still be rescued.
